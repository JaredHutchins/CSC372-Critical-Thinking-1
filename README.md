# CSC372 Week 1 – Critical Thinking Assignment

## What This Is

This repo covers the Week 1 Critical Thinking assignment for CSC372. It's a simple Java program that shows how inheritance works by using an `Employee` superclass and a `Manager` subclass. There's also a `Main` class that handles user input and prints out the results.

## What's Inside

- `Main.java` – Runs the program and handles user interaction
- `Employee.java` – Base class with the core employee info
- `Manager.java` – Inherits from `Employee` and adds a department field

## Key Features

- Inheritance and method overriding
- Clean output to the terminal
- Basic input validation (so your program doesn’t explode)
- Uses `Scanner` for user input

## How to Run

Compile everything:
```
javac *.java
```

Then run it:
```
java Main
```
